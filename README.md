# Little shop, coupon codes 


### Abstract:
I added to a front end that is connected to a backend for information. I wrote a few methods, or added to some already made in order to implement the addition of coupons to the front end site. 

### Installation Instructions:
For the front end, it was forking and cloning a repository and working on it from there. For the back end, it was creating a whole new table of information and connecting it to other parts/tables that had already been implemented. 

### Preview of App:

### Context:
The project was assigned on thursday? evening possibly. We had until the following week on Tuesday evening to turn it in. I personally ended up behind an entire day due to personal reasons. 

### Learning Goals:
A learning goal for me is to just always learn as much as I can from a project. 

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins are getting my tests running and the front end functioning the way it's supposed to. A challenged was choosing the lesser of two evils in what I decided was more important to have more improvement on. For instance, I had to choose between my Postman test examples, and my line coverage. I would either have ends that don't work in postman and line coverage over 98%, or working Postman, and line coverage on 97.38%.
